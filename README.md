# homebrew-tap

Homebrew Tap for [Instagram CLI](https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/instagram-cli).

```
brew tap supreme-gg-gg/tap
brew install instagram-cli
```

Homebrew will install node if it's not installed.
We will consider submitting this to `homebrew-core` if community interest in high. We might consider releasing bottles (pre-built binaries) in the future.
